# Twisted-Cord-Actuator

Currently a work in progress. Will update this repository with experimental data. At present it is just a collection of .step files for reproducing my test rig. Modelled in Fusion 360. .step files are finalised and can be converted to .stl files for 3D printing.

To open .step file:
-Download ZIP file of this repository and expand it
-From within Fusion 360 select "File -> New Design from File" and open .step file
-Either modify the .step file or convert it to an .stl fie for 3D printing
